To send (or push) your changes to a remote repository in Git, follow these steps:

Steps to Push Changes to a Remote Repository
Open Terminal or Command Prompt:

On Windows, use Command Prompt or Git Bash.
On macOS or Linux, use Terminal.
Navigate to Your Repository:


cd path/to/your/repository
Check the Remote Repository:

Verify the remote repository configuration:

git remote -v
This command lists the remote repositories and their URLs.
Push Your Changes:

To push your changes to the default remote repository (origin) and the default branch (main or master), use:

git push origin main
Replace main with the branch name if you are using a different branch.
Example
Navigate to Your Repository:


cd ~/projects/myproject
Verify Remote Configuration:


git remote -v
Output might look like:

origin  https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git (push)
Push Changes to Remote Repository:


git push origin main
Handling Authentication
Authentication: If your remote repository requires authentication, Git might prompt you for your username and password. For GitHub and other services, you might use a personal access token or SSH key instead.
Additional Tips
Push to a New Branch: If you are pushing to a new branch that does not yet exist on the remote, you can create and push the branch like this:


git push origin new-branch-name
Force Push: Be cautious with force pushing, as it overwrites changes on the remote repository:


git push --force origin branch-name
Summary
Check remote: git remote -v
Push changes: git push origin branch-name
This process sends your local commits to the remote repository, making them available to others.
