In Git, commit and push are related but distinct actions:

Commit
Purpose: Saves your changes to the local repository.
Scope: Affects only your local repository.
Command: git commit
Function: Records a snapshot of your changes in the local repository with a commit message.
Example:

git commit -m "Add new feature"
Push
Purpose: Sends your local commits to a remote repository.
Scope: Affects both your local and remote repositories.
Command: git push
Function: Uploads your committed changes to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to share with others or backup.
Example:

git push origin main
Summary of Differences
Commit:

Saves changes locally.
Updates the local repository with a snapshot of your changes.
Does not affect other collaborators or remote repositories.
Push:

Sends committed changes to a remote repository.
Updates the remote repository to reflect your local commits.
Allows others to access your changes and collaborate.
In essence, commit is about saving changes to your local repository, while push is about sharing those changes with others by updating the remote repository.
